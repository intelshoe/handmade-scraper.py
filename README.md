Python scraper to find handmade products and list them in a CSV file.

Organized into 3 main parts (based on MVC):
- scraper.py - takes user input, tells search and parse to execute, and reports errors
- parse.py - parses for potential good content and organizes the information into a csv file
- search.py - performs actualy web searches
